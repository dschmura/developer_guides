# developer_guides

This repository is intended to hold a set of guidelines, principles, ideas, etc related to various aspects of the development process. These are ideas, not gospels. They are not intended to be edicts, or mandates. I am not even willing to claim that they are good ideas. Just ideas.

## [6 Week Release Cycle](6_week_releaes_cycle.md)

I heard about the 6 week release cycle on a couple of podcasts, mostly discussing Ember.js. I liked the broad implications of setting up a 6 week release cycle. The discussions usually included some variant of 'If a feature isn't ready for release at the 6 week mark, that is fine, just keep working on it and you will get it in for the next one.' 

I like how this shifts the focus to the quality of the feature (the code etc...) and away from arbitrary deadlines. 

To hit the right spot though, it is going to take some proactive instruction. We work with 'clients', and explaining how we are going to be adhering to this schedule is going to be important. They will need to adapt somewhat if they are accustomed to making last minute changes. 

In the long run I think that having a set rhythm and sticking with it will lead to fewer frustrations for everyone. (It is easier to stay on the same page if you start on the same page.)
